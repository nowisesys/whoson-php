Version 1.2.0 (2012-05-14):

    * Added support for filtering on an range of logon sessions (using the
      FirstID and LastID members in class LogonEvent).
      
    * Added support for limiting the number of rows returned. Useful
      for pagination in service consumers.
      
Version 1.1.0 (2012-03-28):

    * NULL timestamps are now mapped to UNIX epoch start (1970-01-01). This
      fixes a compatibility issue with ASP.NET.

    * Filters can now be used in conjunction with active and closes session
      queries. Useful for matching all active logon sessions from a single
      computer.

Version 1.0.0 (2012-02-18):

    * This is the first release of whoson-php, so everything is news :-)
