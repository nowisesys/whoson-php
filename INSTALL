   INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHOSON-PHP


** REQUIREMENTS:

   Tested versions within []. Other versions is probably OK also as this is a
   kind of standard/no funky application.

   + Applications:

     o) Apache Web Server       [2.2.21]
     o) MySQL database          [5.1.56]
     o) PHP                     [5.3.8]
     o) Gentoo Linux 64-bit     [10.0]

   The database is not restricted to MySQL, any database supported by REAR/MDB2
   can be used (see http://pear.php.net/MDB2).

   + PHP PECL/PEAR extensions:

     o) SOAP extension          [Bundled with PHP]
     o) dev-php/PEAR-MDB2       [2.5.0] (*)

   (*) = Tested with MySQL MDB2 driver 1.5.0

** DATABASE:

   The database file (SQL script) is distributed in a separate package, see
   http://it.bmc.uu.se/andlov/proj/whoson/sql/. The SQL package is only needed 
   when setting up the database on the web server.

** INSTALL:

   Unpack the source code somewhere *outside* of your web root, otherwise the
   configuration files (with password in plain text) might get exposed!

     bash$> tar xfvz whoson-php-xyz.tar.gz

   Create config protected version of the configuration files:

     bash$> cd whoson-php/conf
     bash$> cp apache.conf.in apache.conf
     bash$> cp database.conf.in database.conf

   Edit conf/database.conf, pay attention to the selected database driver (the
   phptype value).

   Edit conf/apache.conf, make sure to change the source directory path. Link
   the configuration inside your web application setup, the exact details for
   this step depends on distrubution/customization. Heres mine:

     bash$> cd /etc/apache2/webapps.d/
     bash$> ln -s /var/www/localhost/apps/whoson-php/conf/apache.conf whoson.conf

   In my case, scripts under /etc/apache2/webapps.d/ gets included by the special
   script /etc/apache2/modules.d/99_webapps.conf. Other possiblilities are that
   these are included direct by /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.

** TESTING:

   Your can now test to access the web service from an client computer having
   the package whoson-win (Windows client) or whoson-linux (Linux/Mac OS X)
   installed.

   A tips is to monitor the PHP error log (/var/log/apache2/php_error_log) and
   see if some problem occurs.
